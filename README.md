# Aim : Study of Sets in Python
## Algorithm:
## 1. Unique Event Participants
1.Start.  
2.Create a list of participant names.  
3.Convert the list into a set to remove duplicates and display it.  
4.Stop.  

## 2. Common Subjects of Three Students
1.Start.   
2.Create three sets of subjects.    
3.Find and display common subjects using intersection.   
4.Stop.    

## 3. Cricket and Football Club Students
1.Start.   
2.Create two sets of students for each club.     
3.Find and display common students and students in only one club.  
4.Stop.  

## 4.Absent Students
1.Start.  
2.Create sets of all students and present students.  
3.Find and display absent students using set difference.  
4.Stop.  

## 5. Update Course Codes
1.Start.  
2.Create a set of course codes.  
3.Remove the specified course code and display the updated set.  
4.Stop.  

## Theory:
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements used to store distinct values. Sets are created using curly braces {} or the set() constructor
and automatically remove duplicate elements. 
Some important commands commonly used in set:
add() – Adds a single element.  
update() – Adds multiple elements.  
remove() – Removes an element.   
discard() – Removes an element without raising an errorSet Operations.  


Elements cannot be modified individually, but new elements can be added using the add() or update() methods and removed using remove() or discard(). 
The in keyword is used to check whether an element exists in a set. Python supports mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
## Frozen Set
A frozenset is an immutable set whose elements cannot be changed. Sets are efficient for handling unique data, fast membership testing, and performing mathematical 
and comparison operations.

## Conclusion:
Thus, the study of sets in Python was successfully completed. We learned how to create sets, add and remove elements, check membership, and perform various set operations. 
Sets are efficient for handling unique data and performing mathematical operations in Python.
