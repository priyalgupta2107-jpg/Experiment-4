Theory:
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements used to store distinct values. Sets are created using curly braces {} or the set() constructor and automatically remove duplicate elements. 
Since sets are unordered, they do not support indexing or slicing.

Elements cannot be modified individually, but new elements can be added using the add() or update() methods and removed using remove() or discard(). 
The in keyword is used to check whether an element exists in a set. Python supports mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
A frozenset is an immutable set whose elements cannot be changed. Sets are efficient for handling unique data, fast membership testing, and performing mathematical 
and comparison operations.

Conclusion:
Thus, the study of sets in Python was successfully completed. We learned how to create sets, add and remove elements, check membership, and perform various set operations. 
Sets are efficient for handling unique data and performing mathematical operations in Python.
